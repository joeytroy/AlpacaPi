			<h1>SlitTracker<sup>&copy;</sup></h1>
			<h2>A system for syncing dome rotation to telescope movement</h2>
		</header>

		<main>
			<p>SlitTracker<sup>&copy;</sup> is a system that uses acoustic sensors to keep the dome slit centered on the telescope.
			The system works by placing small ultra-sonic sensors around the perimeter of 
			the front end of the telescope that align with optical axis of the telescope.</p>

			<p>These sensors are simple sonar devices that emit an ultra-sonic sound wave and watch for its return.
			The sensors used have a range of about 300 inches.
			If the telescope is properly centered in the dome slit, then all of the sensors should return infinity which means
			no response was heard.</p>

			<p>When the telescope gets close to the edge of the slit, one or more sensors will return a distance 
			which should be the actual distance to the dome.  At this point, it is time to tell the dome to move.</p>

			<p>An accelerometer is also included so that the system knows which way is down and therefore which way is left and right.
			Then the system tells the dome rotation controller to move a small amount in the appropriate direction.</p>

			<p>The number of sensors used is configurable, however for telescopes 16 inch and larger, 12 sensors are recommended.
			Custom 3D printed mounts are used to hold the sensors and this ring is mounted to the front end of the telescope.</p>

			<p>The system currently works with ASCOM and Alpaca compatible dome drivers. 
			The system can be modified to deal with other dome drive systems.</p>

				<h3>Sensor Ring</h3>
				<img src="images/slittracker01.jpg" alt="Sensor ring" style="width: 85%;">
			</div>

			<p>This sensor ring is for a 16 inch Newtonian with an outside tube diameter of 19 inches.
			This is the front view, the numbers are shown on the front side, 
			they attach to the back thus making the clock positions normal.</p>

			<p>Since each ring is custom made, you can chose the colors.
			For closed tube telescopes like a Newtonian, color does not mater. 
			For open tube telescopes like a PlaneWave, flat black is recommended.</p>

			<h3>Advantages</h3>
			<p>Most dome tracking systems rely on a very complex model of the telescope geometry and movement to
			determine the actual position of the telescope.  This is especially complex with German Equatorial mounts.</p>

			<p>Once this position is calculated, the desired azimuth is sent to the dome controller 
			which is expected to put the dome in exactly the position.</p>

			<p>Any mistake along the way can cause the dome to not be centered on the telescope.
			The more common problem is the dome controller's inability to exactly position the dome.</p>

			<p>With SlitTracker<sup>&copy;</sup>, there is no calculation required, the dome controller is told
			to move a bit when needed.  
			The system will even work when manually moving the telescope as long as it is not moved to fast.
			It does require that the slit be open.  
			When connected to an ASCOM or Alpaca dome driver, the system will return an error of told to
			start tracking if the door is not open.</p>

			<h3>Hardware</h3>
			<p>The hardware is mostly off the shelf items consisting of a Raspberry Pi and an Arduino Mega.</p>

			<p>The wiring consists of 3 CAT-5 cables running from the front end of the telescope down to the electronics.
			The Raspberry Pi is normally powered by POE (Power Over Ethernet).
			The electronics are best placed on the telescope to reduce wiring. 
			The only thin needed is the ethernet connection.  
			Wireless is an option, but you then have to run power.
			The recommended connection is wired POE.</p>

			<p>If you choose to have a custom ring designed, 
			the STL/STEP files to print the components will be supplied as part of the documentation package 
			which will allow you to print replacements if needed.</p>

			<h3>Software</h3>
			<p>The software is all open source so you will have complete copy of the source code for the entire system.</p>

			<p>The system also provides a web interface to view status.</p>

			<p>Commands can be automated via Linux shell scripts, samples provided.</p>

			<h3>Support</h3>
			<p>Since it is open source, there is never a fee for software updates.</p>

			<p>Remote updates and diagnostics can be performed if a VPN connection into the observatory network is available.</p>

			<h3>Cost</h3>
			<p>Since this project is all open source, there is no charge for the actual software. 
			There will be costs for any custom work required for non-ASCOM/Alpaca control systems.</p>

			<p>Costs are based on time and materials for a turn-key installation. 
			The cost of the custom sensor ring is based on the diameter of the outside diameter of the telescope front end.</p>
