				<h1 class="text-center">AlpacaPi Overview</h1>
				<p><em>AlpacaPi</em> is a suite of software that implements the Alpaca protocol for control of astronomy
							telescopes, cameras etc.
				<em>AlpacaPi</em> was designed to run primarily on Raspberry-Pi hardware but will run on any Linux system.</p>

				<p>Alpaca is a network protocol based on HTML and JSON for sending commands and data back and forth between
				client programs and device drivers (servers). These can run on the same computer or on separate computers.</p>

				<p>The <em>AlpacaPi</em>  suite is written in C++.
				It takes advantage of the C++ inheritance to simplify the implementation.
				The top level takes care of all of the network communications and parses the incoming commands.
				It then figures out which device the command is for and calls the appropriate handler.
				With the exception of the management driver, only level 3 instances are created. (see class structure below)</p>

				<p><em>AlpacaPi</em> implements all of the drivers in one application.
				On startup, it looks to see what is attached, for example if it discovered 2 ZWO cameras and 1 ATIK CameraDriver,
				it would create 3 camera drivers (0,1,2) that could be used interdependently.
				I have actually done this and it works just fine.</p>

				<p>In my normal setup, one Raspberry-Pi is connected to
				a ZWO camera,
				a Moonlite NiteCrawler focuser and
				a ZWO filterwheel.</p>

				<p>In this case, it would create 4 devices, a camera, a focuser, a rotator, and a filterwheel.
				Actually it would create 5 devices because every driver needs a managment driver.
				For those that are not familiar with the Moonlite NiteCrawler focusers,
				they have a focuser and rotator in the same unit so both a focuser and rotator device are created.</p>

				<p>This is the output of my discovery dump program for this example.</p>

				<h1 class="text-center">Client applications</h1>
				<p>Once you have drivers running, you need an application to control it.
				The drivers have no direct user interface are designed to be only talked to through a network connection.</p>

				<p>As stated above, a client application needs to know what device to talk to.
				You could specify the exact IP address and port if you know it, or use the discovery protocol.
				One thing to note, the discovery protocol only works on your local subnet.
				For most people this is fine, but if you want to control a REMOTE device, you will need to specify the IP and port.</p>

				<p>The client would issue a discovery protocol query and look for the devices it knows how to talk to.
				In this example we are running my camera gui program. As you can see from the client dump above,
				it has found a camera at ip 192.168.1.164 on port 6800.
				It also noticed that there was a filter wheel on the same device.
				This camera application is smart enough to know how to talk to both of them.
				If a filter wheel does not exist, that interface is not displayed as in the 2nd image.</p>

				<div class="image-gallery">
					<img src="images/Camera-newt16-screenshot.jpg" alt="Camera GUI with filter wheel">
					<img src="images/Camera-wo71-screenshot.jpg" alt="Camera GUI without filter wheel">
				</div>

				<p>My focuser application is specifically designed to look exactly like the MoonLite NiteCrawler application.
				As in the case of the camera and the filter wheel.
				This app recognizes that there is both a focuser and a rotator on the same device.
				It will also work with the normal MoonLite focuser controller that does not have the rotator.</p>

				<p>The image on the right is for a focuser that does not have an integrated rotator.
				Again, designed to look just like the MoonLite application.</p>

				<div class="image-gallery">

			<section id="building" class="section-anchor">
				<h1 class="text-center">Building AlpacaPi</h1>
				<p><em>AlpacaPi</em> is built using a Makefile.
				This Makefile is old school in that it is maintained manually and not automatically like some build systems.
				The Makefile controls what is being built, for what platform and what options are enabled.</p>

				<p><strong>Recommended:</strong> Use <code>setup_complete.sh</code> which provides an interactive interface to select
				which drivers to include in your build. The setup script handles all dependencies and builds everything automatically.
				See the <a href="index.html">installation page</a> for details.</p>

				<p><strong>Advanced:</strong> For manual builds, if you only have ZWO cameras, there is no need to compile in the support for ATIK or QHY cameras.
				Doing so requires that those libraries be present.
				If you dont have them, there is no need to download them and install them.
				Turning off support is done by commenting out a define statement.</p>

				<p>To disable the ATIK support, comment this line out by putting a "#" in front of it</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p><strong>Enabled:</strong></p>
					<pre>cpp	:	DEFINEFLAGS		+=	-D_ENABLE_ATIK_</pre>
					<p><strong>Disabled:</strong></p>
					<pre>#cpp	:	DEFINEFLAGS		+=	-D_ENABLE_ATIK_</pre>
				</blockquote>

			<section id="operation" class="section-anchor">
				<h1 class="text-center">Alpaca operation</h1>
				<p>The alpaca devices drivers are the "server" they sit and "listen" for a request exactly like a web server.</p>

				<p>Each alpaca driver must listen on 2 ports, normally implemented in 2 different threads.</p>

				<p>One thread is the "discovery" protocol which MUST listen on port 32227, this is simply a UDP connection listening for broadcast messages. When one request received, it reports back a very simple JSON packet that looks like</p>

				<pre>    {"alpacaport": 6800}</pre>

				<p>The number, 6800 in this case, is the TCP/IP port that the other thread is listening on.</p>

				<p>Technically the discovery thread is not really required. I know of some implementations that do not use it.
				However it puts the responsibility on the client program to be told the address and port manually.</p>

				<p>The other thread listens on its own port (in this case 6800) for HTTP commands</p>

				<p>On your client machine, you can then go to that IP address with a web browser as follows</p>

				<pre>    http://ipaddress:6800/setup</pre>

				<p>(refer to
				<a href="https://ascom-standards.org/api/?urls.primaryName=ASCOM%20Alpaca%20Management%20API" target="_blank">
				https://ascom-standards.org/api/?urls.primaryName=ASCOM%20Alpaca%20Management%20API</a>
				)</p>

				<p>It also responds to Alpaca commands which look like this</p>

				<pre>http://192.168.1.89:6800/api/v1/telescope/0/interfaceversion</pre>

				<ul>
					<li><strong>192.168.1.89</strong> is the IP address of the alpaca server (device)</li>
					<li><strong>6800</strong> is the port</li>
					<li><strong>api</strong> is the string telling the server it is an api command</li>
					<li><strong>v1</strong> is the Alpaca version</li>
					<li><strong>telescope</strong> is the device type</li>
					<li><strong>0</strong> is the device number (in case the driver is controlling more than one)</li>
					<li><strong>interfaceversion</strong> is the command</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Refer to
				https://ascom-standa...paca Device API</p>

				<p>The Alpaca driver never initiates any communication. It is the "server"</p>

				<p><strong>Normal operation:</strong></p>

				<ol>
					<li>Run a client program such as a camera controller.</li>

					<li>This program, the client, would send out the discovery query via a broadcast to port 32227, it would then listen for responses. For each response, it would use the management interface to query what kind of device it is.
					In this example, we are looking for cameras.</li>

					<li>For each camera we find, open up a controller window to control THAT camera.
					If no cameras are found, report the fact and exit.</li>

					<li>Refer to the application section above for an example.</li>

					<li>The client then, on its own, periodically sends commands to the camera driver asking for information or sending a command.

					For example, get camera type, specs etc and display to the user.
					The user then clicks on TAKE PICTURE. The client sends the command to the driver/server to do that operation.</li>

					<li>Note: EACH COMMAND is a HTTP get/put command, the TCP port is opened, the command is sent (using HTTP), the response is received and the connections is CLOSED.

					All of the responses are JSON</li>

					<li>The client polls the driver asking if its done, when it is, it asks for the picture data, gets the data and does what it wants with it. (i.e. save it).</li>
				</ol>

			<section id="remote" class="section-anchor">
				<h1 class="text-center">Connecting ASCOM to ALPACA.</h1>

				<p>ASCOM programs know NOTHING about Alpaca, this is where the ASCOM/Alpaca bridge comes in.
				It runs on your Windows machine and it uses the discovery protocol to find Alpaca devices on the network.
				It then allows you to create a "virtual" ASCOM device on your Windows machine that "translates" all of the ASCOM commands to Alpaca commands.</p>

				<p>It is VERY IMPORTANT to note that there is a one-to-one translation.
				That is the Alpaca commands are the EXACT same commands ASCOM already uses.
				The ONLY difference is the method that the data is moved back and forth.
				In normal ASCOM, this is done with the Windows COM interface.
				With Alpaca, it is HTTP/JSON using what is called a RESTful interface. (I dont think the "RESTful" part is relevant, since I implement everything at the TCP/IP level).</p>

				<p>Once this "virtual" devices has been created, your existing ASCOM programs will be able to talk to ALPACA devices.</p>

				<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> I do not use Windows, and except for the use of the ASCOM test program called CONFORM,
				I have never used ASCOM in any way nor have ever used an ASCOM program to control anything in my observatory.</p>
