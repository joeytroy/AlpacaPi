			<p><em>Alpaca</em> is the new protocol from the ASCOM community for controlling astronomy equipment.
			Alpaca is 100% backwards compatible with ASCOM but instead of using COM (Component Object Mode) which is
			exclusive to Windows, Alpaca uses HTTP and JSON for data communications.
			This allows it to run across multiple machines in a client/server or user/driver mode.
			It also allows you to use any platform you want and no longer are tied to Windows.
			In fact you can run the system with no Windows machines at all.</p>

			<p><em>AlpacaPi</em> is my implementation of the Alpaca protocol to run on Linux,
			specifically it was designed to run on the Raspberry-Pi, which is why I call it AlpacaPi.
			It will run on just about any flavor of Linux and will run on both 32-bit and 64-bit Linux.</p>

			<p><em>AlpacaPi</em> implements all of the drivers in one application.
			On startup, it looks to see what is attached, for example if it discovered 2 ZWO cameras and 1 ATIK Camera,
			it would create 3 camera drivers (0,1,2) that could be used interdependently.
			I have actually done this and it works just fine.</p>

			<p>My normal configuration in my observatory is 3 imaging scopes on one mount, each of a different size.
			Each one has one Raspberry-Pi to control it.
			Each imaging setup has
			a camera,
			a filter wheel,
			a Moonlite NiteCrawler focuser which is implemented as a focuser AND a rotator.</p>
			<p>This only requires one copy of the alpacapi driver, which handles all of 4 of the above listed devices.</p>

			<p><em>AlpacaPi</em> is written in C/C++ and runs on Linux, it is open source.

			<h1 class="text-center">Installation</h1>

			<p>AlpacaPi uses OpenCV for all of the graphics and image processing such as saving images from the camera.
			In almost all cases, OpenCV is required.
			The only time it is not required is when AlpacaPi is only used for a driver such as a roll off roof.</p>

			<p>The installation process has been simplified with an automated setup script that handles all dependencies,
			libraries, and configuration. You only need to ensure git is installed, then run the setup script.</p>

			<p>You can copy the text that is in <span class="highlight-green">green</span> and paste into your terminal window.
			The command to paste into a terminal window is SHIFT-CTRL-V</p>

				<li class="installation-step">
					<h2>Make sure git is installed</h2>
					<pre><code class="green-text">git --version</code>
		git version 2.39.2</pre>
					<p>If it is not installed (any version will work)</p>
					<pre><code class="green-text">sudo apt-get install git</code></pre>
				</li>

				<li class="installation-step">
					<h2>Clone AlpacaPi repository</h2>
					<pre><code class="green-text">git clone https://github.com/msproul/AlpacaPi.git
cd AlpacaPi</code></pre>
				</li>

				<li class="installation-step">
					<h2>Run the setup script</h2>
					<pre><code class="green-text">./setup_complete.sh</code></pre>
					<p>The setup script will guide you through the installation process with interactive prompts. It will:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Check and install build tools (gcc, g++, make, cmake, pkg-config)</li>
						<li>Check and install system libraries (libusb, libudev, libi2c, libjpeg, libgtk)</li>
						<li>Install FITS library (cfitsio)</li>
						<li>Check and install OpenCV (via package manager - recommended, or from source if needed)</li>
						<li>Install USB device rules for cameras and other devices</li>
						<li>Install vendor SDKs (ZWO, ATIK, QHY, etc.) if present</li>
						<li>Download extra data for SkyTravel (OpenNGC, Milky Way outline) if desired</li>
						<li>Verify build environment</li>
						<li>Optionally build AlpacaPi with selected drivers</li>
					</ul>
					<p><strong>Note:</strong> The setup script can be run multiple times safely. It will detect what's already installed
					and skip those steps. You can also run it again later to install additional components.</p>
					<p><strong>OpenCV Installation:</strong> On Raspberry Pi, OpenCV is installed via package manager (fast, ~5 minutes).
					Compiling from source takes 4+ hours and is only needed if package manager installation fails.</p>
				</li>

				<li class="installation-step">
					<h2>Build AlpacaPi (if not done during setup)</h2>
					<p>If you didn't build during setup, or want to rebuild with different options:</p>
					<pre><code class="green-text">./setup_complete.sh</code></pre>
					<p>When prompted, select "Build AlpacaPi now" and choose which drivers to include.</p>
					<p>Alternatively, you can build manually using the Makefile. For details on building specific drivers,
					click on the <a href="drivers.html">DRIVERS</a> link at the top of this page.</p>
				</li>
			</ol>

			<h2>Additional Information</h2>
			<p><strong>Uninstall:</strong> To remove AlpacaPi components from your system:</p>
			<pre><code class="green-text">./setup_complete.sh --uninstall</code></pre>

			<p><strong>Note:</strong> The setup script automatically detects and configures OpenCV (supports both version 3 and 4),
			handles SkyTravel builds, and manages all dependencies. For advanced build options or specific driver configurations,
			see the <a href="drivers.html">DRIVERS</a> page.</p>
